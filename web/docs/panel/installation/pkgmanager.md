# Package Panel Installation

Please see the [Minimum Requirements](../overview.md#minimum-requirements) section in the Panel Overview documentation.

With the APT/RPM repository, you can directly install Calagopus from your package manager. Select your package manager below:

=== With APT
#### Prerequisites
This guide assumes you have PostgreSQL and Valkey installed on your server. You can replace Valkey with Redis, although keep in mind that Valkey is much faster than Redis. This guide assume you are using Valkey.

To install PostgreSQL, [click me to view the guide](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt) to add the APT repository, and then install PostgreSQL:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql-18
```
Then, start PostgreSQL when the server reboots:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now postgresql
```

To install Valkey, run the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y valkey
``` 

Then, start Valkey when the server reboots:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable valkey-server
sudo systemctl start valkey-server
```

#### Add the repository
The first step to install Calagopus is to add the Calagopus APT repository. If the APT repository is already added, you can skip this step. To do so, on your server run theses commands:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://packages.calagopus.com/pub.gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/calagopus-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/calagopus-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.calagopus.com/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/calagopus.list
apt update
```

#### Install Calagopus Panel
Now that the repository has been added, you can now install the Calagopus Panel package. You can do this by running the following commands:
```bash
apt install -y calagopus-panel
```

#### Database Configuration
You will need a database setup and a user with the correct permissions created for that database before continuing any further. To do so, first login to PostgreSQL:
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```
Then, create the user and database and grant the user all permissions:
```sql
CREATE USER calagopus WITH PASSWORD 'yourPassword';
CREATE DATABASE panel OWNER calagopus;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE panel TO calagopus;
exit
```

#### Configure Environment Variables 

Before starting the Panel, you need to configure the environment variables. By default, the `.env` is not included in the package, you can download it manually by running the following commands:
```bash
mkdir -p /etc/calagopus
cd /etc/calagopus

curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calagopus/panel/refs/heads/main/.env.example
ls -lha # should show you the .env file
```

Edit the `.env` with your preferred text editor and modify the environment variables as needed. See the [Environment Configuration documentation](../environment.md) for more details on each variable. Make sure to configure PostgreSQL/Redis and your app encryption keys in the `.env` file.

To set the `DATABASE_URL` variable, replace the value below with your own values, for example: `calagopus` is the user, `yourPassword` is your user's password, and `panel` is your database name:
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://calagopus:yourPassword@localhost:5432/panel"
```

`REDIS_URL` can stay to the default value `redis://localhost`, unless Redis is on another server, where you will have to modify this string.

You can use this script to set the `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` variable to a random value:

```bash
RANDOM_STRING=$(cat /dev/urandom | LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 16 | head -n 1)
sed -i -e "s/CHANGEME/$RANDOM_STRING/g" .env
```

#### Test the configuration

To test the configuration, you can run:
```bash
calagopus-panel
```

If everything works correctly, the panel should not show any errors and will start the HTTP server, in which case you can kill the panel with Ctrl-C.

#### Install Panel as a Service
To ensure that the panel starts automatically on system boot, you can install it as a systemd service. Create a new service file by running:
```bash
calagopus-panel service-install
```
This will also start the service and enable it to start on boot. To check the status of the Panel service, you can run:
```bash
systemctl status calagopus-panel
```
If everything went well, you should be able to access the Panel by navigating to `http://<your-server-ip>:8000` in your web browser and see the OOBE (Out Of Box Experience) setup screen.

=== With RPM
#### Prerequisites
This guide assumes you have PostgreSQL and Redis installed on your server.

To install PostgreSQL, [click me to view the guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/) to add the RPM repository, initialize the database and enable automatic start (the command should start with `sudo systemctl`). For example, if you use Fedora 43 and are on a x86_64 architecture, you would run:
```bash
sudo dnf install -y https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/reporpms/F-43-x86_64/pgdg-fedora-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
sudo dnf install -y postgresql18-server
```

You may need to also install the contrib package of PostgreSQL:
```bash
sudo dnf install -y postgresql18-contrib
```

Then, start PostgreSQL when the server reboots:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable postgresql-18
sudo systemctl start postgresql-18
```

To install Valkey, run the following commands:
```bash
sudo yum install valkey
```

Then, start Valkey when the server reboots:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable valkey-server
sudo systemctl start valkey-server
```

#### Add the repository
The first step to install Calagopus is to add the Calagopus RPM repository. If the RPM repository is already added, you can skip this step. To do so, on your server run theses commands:
```bash
sudo rpm --import https://packages.calagopus.com/pubring.gpg
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/calagopus.repo > /dev/null <<EOF
[calagopus]
name=Calagopus Repository
baseurl=https://packages.calagopus.com/rpm
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.calagopus.com/pubring.gpg
EOF
```

#### Install Calagopus Panel
Now that the repository has been added, you can now install the Calagopus Panel package. You can do this by running the following commands:
```bash
dnf install calagopus-panel
```

#### Database Configuration
You will need a database setup and a user with the correct permissions created for that database before continuing any further. To do so, first login to PostgreSQL:
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```
Then, create the user and database and grant the user all permissions:
```sql
CREATE USER calagopus WITH PASSWORD 'yourPassword';
CREATE DATABASE panel OWNER calagopus;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE panel TO calagopus;
exit
```

```

Edit the `.env` with your preferred text editor and modify the environment variables as needed. See the [Environment Configuration documentation](../environment.md) for more details on each variable. Make sure to configure PostgreSQL/Redis and your app encryption keys in the `.env` file.
