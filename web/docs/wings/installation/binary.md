# Binary Wings Installation

Please see the [Minimum Requirements](../overview.md#minimum-requirements) section in the Wings Overview documentation.

## Getting Started

### Install Docker

The Calagopus Wings Daemon requires Docker to be installed and running on the host machine to manage game server containers.
You can validate your Docker installation by running:

```bash
docker --version
```

If Docker is not installed, please refer to the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) for your operating system.
In many cases running Dockers installation script is the easiest way to get started:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | CHANNEL=stable bash
```

### Install the Wings Binary

Next, you need to download and install the Wings binary. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/calagopus/wings/releases/latest/download/wings-rs-$(uname -m)-linux" -o /usr/local/bin/wings
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wings
```

This will download the latest version of Wings for your architecture and make it executable using `wings`.
To test that the installation was successful, you can run:

```bash
wings version
```

### Configure Wings

Before starting Wings, you need to configure it to connect to your Calagopus Panel. To do this, create the Node on the Panel using this guide [here](../../panel/next-steps/add-node.md).
Then, paste the copied configuration command into your terminal, which will look something like this:

```bash
wings configure --join-data xxxxxx
```

To test the configuration, you can run:

```bash
wings
```

This will start Wings in the foreground, and you should see it connecting to the Panel.

### Install Wings as a Service

To ensure that Wings starts automatically on system boot, you can install it as a systemd service. Create a new service file by running:

```bash
wings service-install
```

This will also start the service and enable it to start on boot. To check the status of the Wings service, you can run:

```bash
systemctl status wings
```
